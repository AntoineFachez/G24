# The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four (G-24): Coordinating Developing Country Interests in Global Economic Governance

## Executive Summary

The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development (G-24) serves as a critical coordinating body for developing countries within the framework of the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs)—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG). Established in 1971 by the Group of 77 (G-77), the G-24 provides a platform for its 28 member states, drawn from Africa, Asia, and Latin America & the Caribbean, to formulate and articulate collective positions on international monetary and development finance issues. Its mandate, initially focused on monetary affairs, expanded in 1976 to encompass development concerns, reflecting the evolving challenges faced by its members. China participates as a "Special Invitee," reflecting its unique global economic role and shared interests with the group on certain BWI matters.

Operating through biannual Ministerial and Deputies' meetings strategically timed before key IMF and World Bank gatherings, and supported by a permanent Secretariat (with services provided by the IMF), the G-24 functions as an influential "insider" group within the BWI ecosystem. Its primary activities involve coordinating policy stances, disseminated through widely circulated Communiqués, and conducting research via working papers, policy briefs, and dedicated task forces. Key thematic priorities consistently addressed include navigating global economic uncertainties, tackling sovereign debt vulnerabilities, advocating for fundamental BWI governance reform (particularly IMF quotas and voice), scrutinizing IMF lending policies (including controversial surcharges), guiding the World Bank's strategic evolution, securing adequate climate finance, and promoting fairer international tax cooperation.

The G-24's significance lies in its ability to provide a unified voice for a diverse range of developing nations, including major emerging economies. Its influence, however, appears largely incremental and context-dependent. While successful in placing issues on the BWI agenda and achieving some procedural adjustments, the group faces significant hurdles in achieving transformative changes, especially concerning the redistribution of power within the IMF and World Bank, due to the entrenched positions of major shareholders. Its effectiveness is bolstered by its political linkage to the G-77 and its engagement with a network of institutional observers and research partners. The G-24 is poised to remain a relevant actor in global economic governance, addressing persistent challenges like debt and BWI reform while adapting to emerging issues such as digitalization and the complexities of climate transition finance.

## I. The G24: Foundation, Mandate, and Evolution

### A. Establishment and Historical Context

The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development, commonly known as the G-24, was established in 1971 by the Group of 77 (G-77).<sup>1</sup> The G-77 itself represents the largest intergovernmental coalition of developing states within the United Nations system, formed to articulate and advance their collective economic interests and enhance their negotiating capacity on major international economic issues.<sup>2</sup> The G-24 was formally created in 1972 and functions as a specialized "chapter" of the G-77.<sup>1</sup>

Its creation occurred during a period of significant upheaval in the international monetary system, notably the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. This context underscored the urgent need for developing countries to establish a dedicated mechanism to coordinate their perspectives and ensure their interests were considered in the reshaping of global financial architecture.<sup>1</sup> The initial objectives set in 1972 reflected this urgency: to monitor the international monetary situation, evaluate decisions taken within the IMF framework that impacted developing nations, and recommend coordinated positions for the G-77 in forums such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).<sup>1</sup>

The G-24's origin as an instrument of the G-77 highlights its foundation in the broader political solidarity movement of the "Global South." However, its specific and narrower focus on the Bretton Woods Institutions distinguishes it. It acts as a specialized, technical body designed to translate the G-77's overarching political and economic goals into concrete policy positions and actionable negotiating strategies tailored to the specific institutional environment and agendas of the IMF and World Bank.<sup>1</sup> It effectively bridges the gap between the broad political declarations often associated with the G-77 and the technical, often complex, financial negotiations conducted within the BWIs.

### B. Official Mandate

The core mandate of the G-24 is to coordinate the positions of developing countries on international monetary and development finance issues.<sup>1</sup> This coordination is particularly directed towards influencing the deliberations and decisions of the Bretton Woods Institutions.<sup>1</sup> Specifically, the Group focuses its attention on matters appearing on the agendas of the IMF's International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) and the joint IMF-World Bank Development Committee (DC), the principal advisory bodies to the Boards of Governors of these institutions.<sup>1</sup> The overarching goal is to ensure that the collective interests and perspectives of its member developing countries are adequately represented and considered in the highest levels of BWI policymaking.<sup>1</sup>

### C. Evolution of Scope and Role

While initially concentrating on monetary affairs, the G-24's scope formally broadened in 1976. During the Third Ministerial Meeting of the G-77, the G-24's terms of reference were expanded to explicitly include issues related to development finance, thereby encompassing the activities and policies of the institutions comprising the World Bank Group.<sup>1</sup>

Since its inception, the G-24 has operated within a dynamic global economic and financial landscape. Profound changes have necessitated continuous adaptation. The rise of new economic powers and the shift towards greater inclusivity in global economic leadership (symbolized partly by the G20's prominence) have altered the context in which the G-24 operates.<sup>1</sup> Concurrently, new groupings of developing countries have emerged, adding complexity to the landscape of international coordination.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, the agenda confronting the international community has expanded significantly, incorporating complex challenges such as climate change, digitalization, heightened geopolitical tensions, and recurrent financial crises, all of which feature in the deliberations of the IMF and World Bank.<sup>1</sup>

In response to these evolving dynamics, the G-24 has demonstrated a capacity to adapt. It has periodically re-examined its nature, mission, and structure to maintain its relevance and effectiveness.<sup>1</sup> While its formation was largely reactive to the monetary system changes of the early 1970s <sup>1</sup>, its subsequent mandate expansion and its current engagement with contemporary issues—such as climate finance mechanisms, central bank digital currencies, artificial intelligence risks, and international tax cooperation <sup>5</sup>—indicate a proactive approach. The Group seeks not only to react to crises but also to shape the discourse and policy responses related to emerging structural challenges pertinent to the development prospects of its members.

## II. Structure and Membership

### A. Organizational Framework

The G-24 conducts its work primarily through high-level political meetings involving the Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors of its member states.<sup>2</sup> These Ministerial meetings are held twice a year, strategically scheduled to occur just prior to the Spring and Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank.<sup>3</sup> This timing ensures that the G-24's coordinated positions can be formulated and presented effectively to influence the discussions within the IMFC and Development Committee.<sup>1</sup>

Supporting the Ministerial level are meetings of Deputies (senior officials from Ministries and Central Banks) and sessions of the Committee of the Whole, which facilitate detailed preparatory work and consensus-building.<sup>5</sup> The Group maintains a permanent Secretariat located in Washington D.C..<sup>5</sup> Although the G-24 functions independently and is not an official organ of the IMF, the Fund provides secretariat services to the Group.<sup>2</sup> This operational support from the IMF, combined with the G-24's meeting schedule aligned with BWI events, points to a deeply embedded, symbiotic relationship. This structure facilitates direct and timely input into BWI deliberations but also means the G-24 operates largely within the BWI ecosystem, potentially shaping its focus while also being influenced by the institutions' rhythms and priorities.

Leadership of the G-24 rotates among its members. The structure typically includes a Chair, a First Vice-Chair, and a Second Vice-Chair, representing the different regions.<sup>13</sup> For instance, Côte d'Ivoire held the chairmanship in 2023 <sup>3</sup>, while in 2007, Argentina chaired, with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Syria serving as Vice-Chairs.<sup>13</sup>

### B. Member States and Regional Representation

The G-24 membership is composed of developing countries drawn from three distinct geographical regions: Africa, Asia, and Latin America & the Caribbean.<sup>5</sup> While the name suggests 24 members, the actual number has fluctuated slightly. The official G-24 website and multiple sources confirm that the group currently comprises 28 full members.<sup>2</sup> The initial JSON data provided listed 27 members, omitting Haiti, which is confirmed as a member by official sources.<sup>3</sup>

Membership is technically open to any member of the larger G-77, allowing for potential expansion, although the core group has demonstrated considerable stability over time.<sup>2</sup> The regional balance is a constitutive element of the group's structure, ensuring representation across the developing world.

Note: Haiti was included based on multiple sources <sup>2</sup> confirming its membership, despite its absence in the initial JSON data.

### C. Observers and Special Invitees

Beyond its full members, the G-24 structure includes participants with observer status. These are categorized as Country Observers and Institutional Observers.<sup>16</sup>

**Country Observers:** Currently, Angola, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates hold this status.<sup>16</sup> Their participation allows them to follow discussions and potentially offer perspectives, supporting the group's aim of advancing developing country interests in global economic governance.<sup>16</sup>

**Institutional Observers:** A diverse range of international organizations participate as observers. These include:

* Arab Monetary Fund
* International Labour Organization (ILO)
* Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
* UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA)
* UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)
* Islamic Development Bank
* the South Centre
* Central American Monetary Council
* the G-77 itself
* the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID)
* UNCTAD

The presence of these observers, particularly research-oriented bodies like the South Centre <sup>9</sup> and UN agencies, suggests the G-24 operates within a wider network. This network likely provides valuable analytical input, reinforces policy positions, and helps amplify the G-24's messages beyond the immediate confines of the BWIs.

**China:** China occupies a unique position within the G-24 framework. It has participated as a "Special Invitee" since the group's meetings in Gabon in 1981.<sup>2</sup> China attends and addresses the plenary ministerial meetings but is not considered a full member.<sup>11</sup> Its status is often listed separately or with an asterisk on official G-24 documentation <sup>14</sup>, underscoring its distinct category.<sup>18</sup> This long-standing arrangement reflects China's significant weight in the global economy and its political alignment with developing countries on numerous BWI-related issues, such as governance reform.<sup>20</sup> The "Special Invitee" status allows China to engage with and potentially influence G-24 deliberations, leveraging the group's collective voice when interests align, without being formally bound by G-77/G-24 membership protocols. It also demonstrates the G-24's pragmatic approach to engaging with a major global player whose economic trajectory differs from many members but whose stance on systemic international financial issues often converges.

## III. Core Activities and Areas of Focus

### A. Coordination and Policy Formulation

The fundamental activity of the G-24 is the coordination of its members' positions ahead of key BWI meetings, specifically the IMFC and Development Committee sessions.<sup>1</sup> The biannual meetings of Ministers and Governors, along with the preparatory meetings of Deputies, serve as the primary forums for discussion, negotiation, consensus-building, and the formulation of collective strategies on critical monetary and development finance issues.<sup>3</sup>

The most visible output of this coordination process is the G-24 Communiqué, typically issued following the Ministerial meetings.<sup>5</sup> These communiqués articulate the group's agreed stance on the current global economic situation, risks facing developing countries, and specific policy proposals or critiques directed at the IMF and World Bank.<sup>7</sup> Released publicly and often timed to coincide with the start of the IMF/WB Spring and Annual Meetings, they serve as a key instrument for communicating the collective views of member countries to the institutions and the wider international community.<sup>8</sup> Communiqués are often made available in multiple languages, including English, Arabic, French, and Spanish.<sup>5</sup>

### B. Research and Analysis

To underpin its policy positions and advocacy efforts, the G-24 engages in research and analysis, often facilitated by its Secretariat and in collaboration with partner institutions.<sup>5</sup> This analytical work aims to provide member countries with robust evidence and arguments to support their stances in complex technical discussions within the BWIs.

The research output takes various forms, including Working Papers, Policy Briefs, Books, and Special Reports.<sup>5</sup> Recent examples of research topics highlight the breadth of issues tackled: the potential of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for global payments, critiques of IMF lending rate policies and surcharges, analysis of tax incentives, proposals for reforming the Bretton Woods system, studies on de-dollarization trends, strategies for domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to finance Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate action, and approaches to financing sustainable development through the real economy.<sup>5</sup>

The G-24 also establishes dedicated working groups or task forces to delve deeper into specific priority areas. Notable examples include a Task Force on Climate, Development and the IMF, and a Working Group on Tax.<sup>5</sup> Furthermore, the G-24 collaborates with external partners on research projects, such as the joint call for papers with the South Centre comparing potential revenues from different international tax rule proposals (UN vs. OECD Subject To Tax Rule).<sup>9</sup> This research function is not merely academic; it directly informs the G-24's policy positions and strengthens its capacity to engage credibly on technically demanding issues, providing analytical weight to its political demands.

### C. Key Thematic Priorities

Analysis of G-24 communiqués and research output reveals several recurring thematic priorities:

* **Global Economic Outlook and Risks:** The G-24 consistently monitors and comments on the state of the global economy, focusing on growth prospects, inflation dynamics, financial stability, and the specific risks and vulnerabilities faced by Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) and Low-Income Countries (LICs).<sup>7</sup> Concerns are often expressed about divergent recovery paths between advanced and developing economies, and the potential for global shocks to disproportionately harm the latter.<sup>7</sup>
* **Debt Sustainability:** Rising levels of sovereign debt in developing countries, the burden of high debt service costs (often exacerbated by currency depreciation), and the inadequacy of existing debt resolution mechanisms are major and persistent concerns.<sup>7</sup> The G-24 advocates for stronger international action, including effective implementation and potential reform of debt relief initiatives and frameworks.<sup>7</sup>
* **IMF/WB Governance Reform:** A central and long-standing demand is for fundamental reform of the governance structures of the BWIs to increase the voice, representation, and quota shares of developing countries.<sup>7</sup> This is framed as essential for enhancing the legitimacy and effectiveness of the institutions, ensuring they better reflect the shifts in global economic weight.<sup>7</sup> Progress on IMF quota reviews is closely monitored and often criticized as insufficient.<sup>7</sup>
* **IMF Lending Policies:** The G-24 actively engages on the terms and conditions of IMF lending. This includes advocating for adequate access levels to Fund resources, reviewing the appropriateness of policy conditionality, pushing for reforms to lending instruments like the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), and mounting a sustained challenge to the IMF's surcharge policy, which imposes additional fees on heavily indebted borrowing countries.<sup>7</sup>
* **World Bank Evolution:** The group closely follows and comments on the strategic direction of the World Bank Group, particularly its ongoing "Evolution Roadmap." Key demands include significantly increasing the Bank's financing capacity (through robust IDA replenishments and potential IBRD capital increases), ensuring operational efficiency, striking a balance between addressing global challenges (like climate change) and fulfilling core development mandates, and upholding principles of country ownership.<sup>7</sup>
* **Climate Finance:** Recognizing the threat of climate change, the G-24 emphasizes the need for developed countries to fulfill their climate finance commitments (e.g., the $100 billion annual goal). It calls for the effective operationalization of new mechanisms like the Loss and Damage Fund and advocates for adequate resources for climate adaptation and mitigation through BWI-linked channels (like the RSF and Climate Investment Funds), while stressing principles of climate justice, including Just Transition and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities.<sup>7</sup>
* **International Tax Cooperation:** The G-24 actively supports multilateral efforts to combat tax avoidance and evasion by multinational corporations. It advocates for fairer international tax rules that generate substantial revenues for developing countries, often expressing preference for UN-led processes over OECD initiatives, and links effective tax cooperation to enhanced domestic resource mobilization (DRM) capacity.<sup>5</sup>
* **Trade:** The group consistently advocates for an open, rules-based, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system, expressing concern over rising protectionist tendencies and trade tensions that can negatively impact developing economies.<sup>7</sup>

The G-24's activities demonstrate a consistent dual focus. It addresses immediate crises and pressing global economic challenges (such as post-pandemic recovery, inflation spikes, and acute debt distress <sup>7</sup>) while simultaneously pursuing long-term structural reforms aimed at reshaping the global economic and financial architecture (including BWI governance and international tax rules <sup>8</sup>). This approach reflects the necessity for developing countries to manage urgent economic pressures while concurrently challenging systemic factors perceived as disadvantageous to their long-term development prospects.

## IV. Engagement with the IMF and World Bank

### A. Role within the BWI Ecosystem

The G-24 functions as the principal collective voice for developing countries operating within the formal governance structures of the IMF and World Bank.<sup>1</sup> Its institutional rhythm is deliberately synchronized with that of the BWIs; its Ministerial meetings and the subsequent release of its Communiqués are timed to directly precede and inform the deliberations of the IMFC and the Development Committee.<sup>1</sup> This positioning allows the G-24 to inject the coordinated perspectives of its members into the BWI policy cycle at critical junctures.

The institutional significance of the G-24 is acknowledged by the BWIs themselves. The heads of the IMF and World Bank, along with senior UN officials, customarily attend G-24 Ministerial meetings, providing a direct channel for dialogue and indicating recognition of the group's representative role.<sup>2</sup>

### B. Advocacy on Key Institutional Issues

The G-24's engagement with the IMF and World Bank is characterized by persistent advocacy on a range of critical institutional issues:

* **IMF Quotas and Governance:** This remains arguably the most fundamental and long-standing area of G-24 advocacy. The group consistently calls for a comprehensive realignment of IMF quotas and voting shares to accurately reflect the increased weight of EMDEs in the global economy.<sup>7</sup> Such reform is presented not merely as a matter of fairness but as essential for bolstering the IMF's legitimacy and effectiveness.<sup>13</sup> While acknowledging incremental steps like the agreement for a third Executive Director chair for Sub-Saharan Africa, the G-24 maintains that these fall far short of addressing the core issue of underrepresentation and continues to press for a new quota formula by agreed deadlines.<sup>7</sup> The slow progress on this front is a recurrent source of disappointment and critique.<sup>13</sup>
* **IMF Surcharges:** The G-24 has mounted a strong and consistent campaign against the IMF's policy of levying surcharges on loans above certain thresholds or outstanding for longer periods. These surcharges are criticized as being regressive (disproportionately affecting countries already facing financial difficulties), pro-cyclical (increasing burdens during crises), and unnecessary given the IMF's strong financial position.<sup>7</sup> The group calls for a review and substantial permanent reduction or elimination of surcharges, or at minimum, their suspension during periods of global stress like the pandemic.<sup>7</sup>
* **IMF Lending Facilities & Conditionality:** Engagement extends to the design, adequacy, and accessibility of IMF lending instruments. The G-24 monitors and provides input on facilities like the RSF (calling for broader eligibility and faster disbursement) and the PRGT (emphasizing the need for sustainable financing, potentially through IMF gold sales).<sup>7</sup> It also scrutinizes access limits and advocates for policy conditionality that is appropriately tailored to country circumstances and supportive of sustainable recovery, rather than imposing undue austerity.<sup>7</sup>
* **World Bank Group Evolution:** The G-24 actively participates in the discourse surrounding the WBG's strategic reforms, particularly the "Evolution Roadmap." It supports the ambition of a "bigger, better, and more efficient" Bank capable of tackling global challenges but insists that this must involve a significant increase in financing capacity (through strong IDA replenishments and adequate IBRD capital).<sup>7</sup> Crucially, the group emphasizes that addressing global challenges like climate change should not come at the expense of traditional development priorities and poverty reduction, and that reforms must enhance country ownership and provide additional concessional finance.<sup>7</sup>
* **Debt Architecture:** Recognizing the escalating debt problems in many developing countries, the G-24 pushes for improvements in the international framework for preventing and resolving sovereign debt crises. This includes providing input into reviews of the joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for LICs and advocating for mechanisms that ensure timely, orderly, and fair debt restructuring when necessary.<sup>7</sup>
* **Climate Finance Mechanisms:** The group advocates for the effective operationalization and adequate funding of climate finance instruments linked to the BWIs. This includes ensuring the RSF delivers on its promise, supporting the Climate Investment Funds, and urging the World Bank to expedite its role as host of the Loss and Damage Fund secretariat, while consistently reminding developed countries of their financing commitments.<sup>7</sup>

The G-24's overall approach can be characterized as an "insider advocacy" strategy. It primarily works within the established governance framework and procedural norms of the BWIs, utilizing its formal access points (Ministerial meetings, communiqués timed for IMFC/DC) to influence policy debates.<sup>1</sup> Its demands generally focus on reforming existing institutional policies and structures rather than rejecting the institutions outright. This strategy aims to leverage the group's recognized position within the system to achieve incremental, albeit meaningful, changes.

A core element of this advocacy involves persistently highlighting the perceived "legitimacy deficit" of the BWIs stemming from the underrepresentation of developing countries.<sup>13</sup> By framing governance reform as essential for institutional effectiveness and credibility, the G-24 seeks to pressure dominant shareholders and build a case for change that transcends narrow national interests.

## V. Assessing the G24's Significance and Influence

### A. Role as a Voice for Developing Countries

The G-24 holds undeniable significance as a platform that enables a diverse group of developing countries and emerging markets to forge and articulate a collective voice on complex international monetary and financial matters.<sup>1</sup> Its membership includes some of the most influential economies in the Global South, such as G20 members India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, and Argentina, alongside many other nations facing distinct development challenges.<sup>8</sup> By coordinating positions, the G-24 helps its members navigate the technical intricacies of BWI policies and promotes their shared economic interests within these powerful institutions.<sup>2</sup>

### B. Effectiveness in Shaping BWI Policies and Agendas

Assessing the G-24's effectiveness yields a nuanced picture. Its communiqués are widely recognized as important barometers of developing country sentiment and frequently help shape the agenda and tone of discussions during the IMF and World Bank Spring and Annual Meetings.<sup>8</sup> The group has demonstrably succeeded in placing and keeping critical issues on the BWI agenda, such as the need for quota reform, the problematic nature of IMF surcharges, and the imperative to balance climate action with broader development goals.<sup>7</sup>

Evidence of direct influence often manifests as incremental policy adjustments or procedural gains. For example, the eventual agreement to create a third Sub-Saharan African seat on the IMF Executive Board, while deemed insufficient by the G-24 to resolve overall underrepresentation, can be seen partly as a response to sustained pressure for greater African voice, a long-standing G-24 concern.<sup>7</sup> The group's positions are also frequently cited and analyzed by civil society organizations, academics, and think tanks focused on global development and finance, indicating that its perspectives resonate and contribute to a broader policy discourse.<sup>8</sup>

However, the G-24's influence faces clear limitations, particularly regarding fundamental structural reforms. Despite decades of consistent advocacy, meaningful progress on redistributing IMF quotas and voting power to better reflect the rise of EMDEs has remained elusive.<sup>7</sup> This underscores the significant constraints imposed by the entrenched governance structures of the BWIs, where the voting power of major advanced economies remains dominant. The G-24 can propose and critique, but lacks the power to unilaterally enact major systemic changes.

### C. Challenges and Limitations

The G-24 faces inherent challenges. Maintaining internal cohesion and forging consensus among 28 member countries with diverse economic circumstances, national priorities, and sometimes competing interests requires significant diplomatic effort [Implied by coordination mandate]. The effectiveness of its advocacy is ultimately constrained by the political will of the major BWI shareholders, who hold decisive voting power, and by the prevailing geopolitical climate.

Therefore, the G-24's influence appears highly contextual and tends to result in incremental adjustments rather than paradigm shifts. It seems more effective in influencing operational policies, lending terms, or the framing of specific programs than in altering the fundamental distribution of power within the institutions. Its success often depends on aligning its proposals with the prevailing discourse or leveraging moments of crisis that create openings for reform.

Furthermore, the G-24 does not operate in isolation. Its significance and impact are amplified through its connections. Its status as a G-77 chapter provides political legitimacy and links its technical work to the broader developing country agenda.<sup>1</sup> Its engagement with institutional observers and research partners like the South Centre provides analytical depth and alternative perspectives, while interactions with civil society help disseminate its positions more widely.<sup>9</sup> The group draws strength from this networked ecosystem to bolster its advocacy efforts.

## VI. Understanding the "Accepting General Compulsory Jurisdiction" Data Point

### A. Definition and Context (ICJ)

The data field "accepting general compulsory jurisdiction" included in the initial JSON data for G-24 members typically relates to the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Specifically, it refers to declarations made by states under Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute, commonly known as the "Optional Clause".<sup>24</sup> By making such a declaration, a state recognizes the jurisdiction of the ICJ as compulsory ipso facto and without the need for a special agreement, concerning legal disputes with any other state that has accepted the same obligation.<sup>24</sup> The types of disputes typically involve questions of international law, the interpretation of treaties, any breach of international obligations, and the nature or extent of reparation for such breaches.

### B. Relevance (or Lack Thereof) to G24 Membership and Function

This particular data point, indicating false for all listed G-24 members in the provided JSON, holds no discernible relevance to the G-24's identity, membership criteria, mandate, or activities. The G-24's focus is strictly confined to coordinating positions on international monetary affairs and development finance, primarily in the context of the IMF and World Bank.<sup>1</sup> It is an intergovernmental policy coordination group, not a body involved in international legal dispute settlement under the ICJ framework.

Whether an individual member state chooses to accept the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction is a sovereign decision pertaining to international law and dispute resolution, entirely separate from its participation in the G-24. The inclusion of this field in the dataset is almost certainly an artifact of the data source's construction. It was likely drawn from a broader database compiling various country-level indicators, including adherence to international legal instruments like the ICJ Statute's Optional Clause. Consequently, this data point offers no insight into the functioning, priorities, or nature of the G-24 itself.

## VII. Conclusion: The G24 in Contemporary Global Economic Governance

### A. Summary of Key Findings

The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four stands as the primary mechanism through which a significant bloc of developing countries coordinates its engagement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. Rooted in the G-77 and established in the early 1970s, its mandate covers the critical nexus of international monetary and development finance issues. Comprising 28 member states from Africa, Asia, and Latin America & the Caribbean, along with observers and the unique participation of China as a Special Invitee, the G-24 operates through a structured process of Ministerial and Deputies' meetings synchronized with the BWI calendar, supported by a Secretariat leveraging IMF services.

Its core activities involve formulating collective positions articulated in influential Communiqués and undertaking supportive research. The G-24 consistently prioritizes navigating global economic instability, addressing sovereign debt crises, pushing for BWI governance reforms to enhance developing country voice, scrutinizing IMF lending policies (especially surcharges), guiding the World Bank's strategic evolution, securing adequate climate finance, and advocating for fairer international tax cooperation. It pursues these goals primarily through an insider advocacy strategy within the BWI framework, persistently challenging the institutions' legitimacy deficits stemming from perceived democratic imbalances.

While the G-24 is a significant collective voice, its influence is largely incremental and context-dependent, facing substantial limitations in achieving fundamental governance changes due to the prevailing power structures within the BWIs. Its effectiveness is enhanced by its political ties to the G-77 and its network of institutional partners. The data point regarding ICJ compulsory jurisdiction, included in the initial information, is extraneous to the G-24's purpose and function.

### B. Outlook and Future Role

The G-24 is poised to remain a relevant and necessary actor in the evolving landscape of global economic governance. Persistent challenges such as recurrent debt distress in developing countries, the financing needs for climate transition and sustainable development, and the ongoing debate about reforming the international financial architecture to reflect a more multipolar world ensure the continued need for such a coordinating body.

The group's future influence will likely depend on several factors: its ability to maintain internal cohesion among its diverse membership, the continued quality and relevance of its technical analysis and policy proposals, its capacity to build and leverage strategic alliances (potentially including engaging with actors beyond its traditional sphere), and ultimately, the responsiveness of major global powers and the BWI leadership to its calls for reform.

Emerging global trends will inevitably shape the G-24's future agenda. The economic and social implications of digitalization, including the rise of CBDCs and the impact of artificial intelligence on labor markets <sup>5</sup>, alongside the complexities of international tax cooperation in a digitalized world <sup>7</sup>, are likely to feature prominently in its forthcoming deliberations and advocacy efforts.

Despite the existence of other forums like the G20, where several G-24 members participate, the G-24 retains a distinct and vital role. Its specific focus on the intricacies of BWI policies and its representation of a broader range of developing countries, including many outside the G20 framework, ensures its enduring relevance.<sup>6</sup> As global economic dynamics continue to shift, the G-24's function as a platform for collective analysis, coordination, and negotiation within the Bretton Woods system remains indispensable for its member states seeking to shape a more equitable and supportive international financial environment.
